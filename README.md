Abstract
Understanding public attitudes toward transit investment is essential for designing politically feasible urban transportation policy. Using more than 1,000 YouTube comments related to transit funding, system performance, and infrastructure debates across Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York City, this paper investigates whether public sentiment toward transit investment is predominantly positive, negative, or polarized. Applying sentiment analysis, TF–IDF keyword extraction, and topic modeling, the analysis reveals that sentiment is highly polarized, with substantial variation across cities. Chicago displays the most positive sentiment, Los Angeles shows elevated negative sentiment rooted in safety and reliability concerns, and New York exhibits mixed attitudes shaped by governance and cost-related issues. The findings demonstrate that public discourse is city-specific and that effective transit investment strategies must adapt to localized concerns.
